    "- Name and date of the artwork\n",
    "- Species and character names\n",
    "- Number of character in each artwork\n",
    "- Facial expressions\n",
    "- Type (previously Medium) (either drawn digitally or traditional with exceptions of programs and tools used)\n",
    "- Medium (is for tools/programs used in an artwork)\n",
    "- Source (either from FurAffinity or DeviantArt)\n",
    "\n",
    "I was also planning to get the most colors used, as in only in each characters, excluding backgrounds, items, etc. However, because I have deal with shading and color correction, it will be a tedious and cumbersome dataset to obtain; yes we can refer it to their fursona's ref sheet and get the colors that way but there are some cases that it won't be available, so for now - I won't add this dataset."
