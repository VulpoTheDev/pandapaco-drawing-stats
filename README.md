# About this project

This crap catalogs karens and shit; the possible inspiration from this project is through the McDonald's broken ice cream machine thingy and it'd be interesting to see how many species he drew lol

## Fetching data

All the data is retrieved from this sheet of Google Sheets; a Python script will then get the CSV off of it, then it will be converted from CSV to JSON file, which will then be parsed through chart.js to display the data.

## Why?

It's not meant to impress him in general, but he'd for sure find it interesting as it's more of a fun project to a new hobby of mine, learning JavaScript and Python in the process of other projects I do.

I wanted to show realtime data from Google Sheets and render data via charts from a website and I'd thought I'll take one of my artists and run it through this process lol I dunno

## Libaries used

* Google Sheets API
* [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org)
