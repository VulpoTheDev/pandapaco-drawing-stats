# Panda Paco Stats Site

This website collects all 1.9K drawings from a furry artist and illustrator *pandapaco*, and fetches different types of data (i.e species drawn, expressions, number of characters drawn, etc)

This project collects title and date of the piece, character's species and names, facial expressions, and the source where I got the data from. This task seem daunting since I have to source it through FurAffinity and DeviantArt for his draft drawings. Drawings from Twitter will unfortunately not be counted to ease the load on my end and the dataset as well since all the data gathered will be hardcoded to the site.

This project began in October 31, 2021, and the possible inspiration from this project is through the McDonald's broken ice cream machine site and it'd be interesting to see in all 1.9K drawings to see said data.

## Why?

It's not meant to impress him in general, but he'd for sure find it interesting as it's more of a fun project to a new hobby of mine, learning JavaScript and Vue.js in the process of other projects I do.

I wanted to show realtime data from Google Sheets and render data via charts from a website and I'd thought I'll take one of my artists and run it through this process. (I lied, as I mentioned earlier, all data will be hardcoded to the site)
